# Hi, I'm Barush Martinez

I am form San Diego CA, and a transfer student. I enjoy spending time outside, whether it be surfing, hiking or running. I wanted to become cargo pilot after UCSB but unfortunately due to the 2020 covid-19 pandemic I will  now aim to becoming a firefighter after college. Geography 176A is the first time I have ever attempted anything with coding, and although difficult at the begging I hope that with time it becomes easier.
